    "Regular expressions use the backslash character (`'\\'`) to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write `'\\\\\\\\'` as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be `\\\\`, and each backslash must be expressed as `\\\\` inside a regular Python string literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with `'r'`. So `r\"\\n\"` is a two-character string containing `'\\'` and `'n'`, while \"\\n\" is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation."

    "### Regular Expression Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some characters, like `'|'` or `'('`, are special. Special characters either stand for classes of ordinary characters, or affect how the regular expressions around them are interpreted. Regular expression pattern strings may not contain null bytes, but can specify the null byte using the `\\number` notation, e.g., `'\\x00'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repetition qualifiers `(*, +, ?, {m,n}`, etc) cannot be directly nested. This avoids ambiguity with the non-greedy modifier suffix `?`, and with other modifiers in other implementations. To apply a second repetition to an inner repetition, parentheses may be used. For example, the expression `(?:a{6})*` matches any multiple of six 'a' characters."

    "    (Caret.) Matches the start of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches immediately after each newline.\n",
    "'$'\n",
    "\n",
    "    Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches before a newline. foo matches both ‘foo’ and ‘foobar’, while the regular expression foo$ matches only ‘foo’. More interestingly, searching for foo.$ in 'foo1\\nfoo2\\n' matches ‘foo2’ normally, but ‘foo1’ in MULTILINE mode; searching for a single $ in 'foo\\n' will find two (empty) matches: one just before the newline, and one at the end of the string.\n",

    "    Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions as are possible. ab* will match ‘a’, ‘ab’, or ‘a’ followed by any number of ‘b’s.\n",

Sometimes this behaviour isn’t desired; if the RE <.*> is matched against <a> b <c>, it will match the entire string, and not just <a>. Adding ? after the qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched. Using the RE <.*?> will match only <a>.\n",

Omitting m specifies a lower bound of zero, and omitting n specifies an infinite upper bound. As an example, a{4,}b will match aaaab or a thousand 'a' characters followed by a b, but not aaab. The comma may not be omitted or the modifier would be confused with the previously described form.\n",

    "    If you’re not using a raw string to express the pattern, remember that Python also uses the backslash as an escape sequence in string literals; if the escape sequence isn’t recognized by Python’s parser, the backslash and subsequent character are included in the resulting string. However, if Python would recognize the resulting sequence, the backslash should be repeated twice. This is complicated and hard to understand, so it’s highly recommended that you use raw strings for all but the simplest expressions.\n",

    "\n",
    "        Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-', for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59, and [0-9A-Fa-f] will match any hexadecimal digit. If - is escaped (e.g. [a\\-z]) or if it’s placed as the first or last character (e.g. [a-]), it will match a literal '-'.\n",

This means that once A matches, B will not be tested further, even if it would produce a longer overall match. In other words, the '|' operator is never greedy.
